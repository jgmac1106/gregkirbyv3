Decided to take all my drafts to Kirby and describe what I am doing as well. Setting up microformats in the photography template. Need to figure out how to add u-featured to the album covers but that involves figuring out how to play a bit more with if statements.

Only drawback so far has been markdown vs html. Markdown being better is opinion and not fact and so far Kirby is a pretty opinionated CMS. I would like to use html. The flexibility you lose just for the ability to not include a closing tag isn't worth it.

Again opinion not fact.
